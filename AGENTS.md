# Working notes for agents

m8-course is a new repository; its purpose has not yet been written down here (as of 2026-11-12 it held no files).

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file, so every agent runtime reads the same notes.

## The primitives

This repository's shape is held by the dotdirs at its root. Each is a
self-contained, file-based protocol bundling its own script and data: the
script operates on the directory it lives in, and the file system is the
protocol. Each ships its own `README.md` with the full contract. Read it
before doing anything non-trivial with that primitive.

- 🪺 nestlings — `.nest/` — arrivals: what just came in, waiting to be tended.
- 🔮 glean — `.glean/` — memory: small, current, revisable guidance.
- 🪡 loom — `.loom/` — finite work: goals, stitches, dependencies, queue order.
- 🐉 lore — `.lore/` — the library: complete, dated records, kept whole.
- 🦫 groundhog — `.groundhog/` — what comes around at a set time: recurring and one-shot items. Use it, not a runtime's own cron, for scheduled wake-ups.

In short: the nest holds what just arrived, glean what is true *now*, the loom
what is still to be done, lore what happened, and groundhog what comes next.

### Start here

1. Read `.glean/findings/INDEX.md`, the always-loaded memory surface:
   one line per finding. Open a body only when it is relevant
   (`./.glean/glean.sh fetch <terms>`).
2. Run `./.loom/loom.sh status`. The loom alone owns open work, blockers and
   queue order. Existing stitches don't widen the user's current request.
3. Read `.nest/tend.md` and inspect `.nest/in/` for arrivals waiting to be
   tended. `inbox/` is a symlink to `.nest/in/`.
4. Consult `.lore/INDEX.md` only when complete evidence or history is needed.
   Lore is dark by default.

## Memory lives in Glean

Glean is this repository's only memory. Don't keep project knowledge in a
runtime's private memory store (for example Claude Code's per-project
`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`), a `memory/` directory or a handoff note.
Those drift from the repository and travel with one tool on one machine. When
you learn something worth carrying into the next session, it becomes a
finding: search first and revise an existing finding rather than adding a
near-duplicate, run `./.glean/glean.sh index`, and commit it with the work that
earned it. Claude Code's auto memory is switched off here in
`.claude/settings.json` (`autoMemoryEnabled: false`).

## Ownership

One arrival may earn several routes: the source kept in lore, a constraint
distilled into glean, a design change in `docs/`, a stitch on the loom. Those
are different consequences of one thing, not competing copies of it. Name the
results in a nest receipt as `lore:<id>`, `glean:<id>`, `loom:<id>` or
`path:<repo-relative-path>`.
